# Lab Assignment 2

This is a lab report for lab assignment 2 in DAT250. In the report I am going to discuss and address the following:

* Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved

* A link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!

* An explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.

* Any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve

## Inspection of database tables 
I had a lot of problems with showing the database tables. The first problem was that I used the wrong version of Intellij. It was not possible to show these types of diagrams in the version I had downloaded. I feel that this could have been communicated to us when we were told to download an IDE. 
When switching to the Intellij Ultimate version it got a lot easier. I had some problems with the connection to the database, but when deleting the 
db directory and then refreshing the database, it showed the updated tables.
