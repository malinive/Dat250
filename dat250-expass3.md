2. Screenshots for:
    * The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)
    * Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant  from each CRUD operation)
    * Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you
3. Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.
4. Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve
