# Assignment 3 

**This lab report will include:** 
1. Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved
2. Screenshots for:
    * The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)
    * Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant  from each CRUD operation)
    * Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you
3. Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.
4. Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve



## 1. Technical problems with MongoDB
I forgot to check the option of "MongoDB as a Windows service" and therefore chose to reinstall it. I don't know if I have installed MongoDB correct because I got a bit confused about mongosh. In the assignment spesifications I interpreted Mongo shell as optional to install, but in the official MongoDB install spesifications it seemed to be important to install (I think mongosh and Mongo shell is the same thing?). I downloaded mongosh, but had problems with adding it as an environment variable. MongoDB has worked for this assignemt, but maybe this will create problems later on. 

I spent some time figuring out how to insert a document into MongoDB compass, but when googling it I found the solution. 


## 2. Screenshots
