# Assignment 4

This report will contain:
* Technical problems with JPA
* A link to the code for experiment 2-4
* Pending issues 


## Technical problems
I didn't understand how to use a web browser to run a GET request targeting http://localhost:8080/counters to check that the service was deployed and operational.
But, after some help from the TA, I ran the App.java file and got it to work in both the web browser and in Postman. 

I had problems with the tests idNotANumber and NonExistingTodos. When adding a try/catch I was able to get all the tests passed.

I had a lot of problems with adding the project to Github. I don't really know what happend, but I had to fork the project, clone it and add the work to the new project. This is something I should investigate during the next assignments. 


## Link to the code for experiments 2-4

## Any pending issues 
None I am aware of.
